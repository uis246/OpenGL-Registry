    void DiscardStrategyEXT(enum strategy)

Discussion
    
    Will void DiscardFenceEXT() be useful to mark start of frame?
    Stop disarding after last swap? What if comands issued too fast? Use frame
    number or DiscardFenceEXT()?
    Should swapbuffers reset strategy?

Example

    //Dispatch first frame commands
    glxSwapBuffersMscOML(...);
    //Dispatch second frame commands while first frame still rendering
    glDiscardStrategyEXT(GL_DISCARD_DRAW);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 100500);
    glBufferSubData(...);
    glxSwapBuffersMscOML(...);
    //Dispatch third frame commands while first still rendering
    glDiscardStrategyEXT(GL_TRUE);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 9000);
    glxSwapBuffersMscOML(...);

    //Here first frame ended rendering
    //glDrawArrays discarded, while glBufferSubData not
    //And now it executes glDrawArrays from third frame
    //So after first frame third will be displayed
